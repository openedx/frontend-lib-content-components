// do NOT @import "@openedx/paragon/scss/core/core"; in any files in this repo, or it will add 400 kB of extra CSS
// to the MFE each time you do so. The following are OK because they are only defining variables like $grey-500:
@import "@edx/brand/paragon/variables";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "@openedx/paragon/scss/core/_functions";
@import "@openedx/paragon/scss/core/_variables";

.total-label {
    border: 1px solid $gray-500;
}
